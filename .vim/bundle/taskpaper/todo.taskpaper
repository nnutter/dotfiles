Issues:
	- #11 Enter creates sub-tasks, but doesn't indent properly or handle sub-projects
	- #20 \tp folds down everything into first heading, not just the project headings

Release:
	Tasks to be completed before next release
	- Note compatibility with ToDoPaper
	- stylesheets for tags (e.g. "fail" produces red bg)
	- include patch for notes. @done
