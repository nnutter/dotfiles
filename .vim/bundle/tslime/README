tslime.vim

This is a simple vim script to send portion of text from a vim buffer to a
running tmux session.

It is based on slime.vim http://technotales.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/like-slime-for-vim/,
but use tmux instead of screen.

However, compared to tmux, screen doesn't have the notion of panes. So, the
script was adapt to take panes into account.

If you use version of tmux < 1.3 , you should use the stable branch. The version
available in that branch isn't aware of panes so it will paste to pane 0 of the
window.
