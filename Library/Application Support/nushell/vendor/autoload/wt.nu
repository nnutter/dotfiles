# Override wt command with split directive passing.
# Creates two temp files: one for cd (raw path) and one for exec (shell).
# WORKTRUNK_BIN can override the binary path (for testing dev builds).
#
# Nushell pipeline workaround (nushell/nushell#12643):
#
# In POSIX shells, pipes are file-descriptor plumbing — stdout flows through
# the pipe while the shell continues executing post-command logic (directive
# processing, exit codes). In nushell, a function's "output" is its return
# value (the last expression), not bytes written to fd1. When an external
# command isn't the last expression, its stdout goes to the terminal as a
# side effect but doesn't flow through `|`.
#
# This means we can't both stream stdout through a pipe AND do post-processing
# (directives, cleanup) in the same function. We handle this by splitting into
# two paths based on the subcommand:
#
# - `list`: Direct passthrough. The binary is the last expression, so stdout
#   streams to the terminal (progressive rendering) and flows through pipes
#   (`wt list --format json | from json`). No directive processing — `list`
#   never emits directives. No directive env vars are set.
#
# - Everything else: Stdout is redirected to a temp file via `o>`, then
#   returned as the function's last expression after directive processing.
#   Stderr flows to the terminal in real-time. The binary sees non-TTY stdout
#   and uses buffered mode, but commands other than `list` don't benefit from
#   progressive rendering anyway.
#
# Completer wired via `@complete` attribute on an untyped `[...args]` rest.
# The parameter-level `string@"completer"` form keeps tokens literal, which
# blocks nushell's normal argument handling for `--flag="value"` (quote
# stripping) and `~` (path expansion). Untyped rest gets that handling once
# nushell/nushell#18131 ships in stable nu; until then `--flag="value"` still
# arrives quoted. See nushell/nushell#18128 for upstream tracking.
